## Game Objective

Flip cards two at a time to find matching word pairs. Clear all pairs to complete a level. Your goal is to use the **fewest moves** and **least time** possible.

## How to Play
```
Click a card (or press `Enter` / `Space` if focused) to flip it.
Flip two cards. If they match, they stay face up with a ✅ tick.
If they don’t match, they flip back after a short delay.
Match all pairs to complete the level.
Use the "Next Level" button to advance or **"Restart Level"** to try again.
View your best score, stored locally for each level.
```
